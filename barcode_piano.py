#Barcode piano player
#Based on a request from Alice Bernard on the Labenbib Facebook group - https://www.facebook.com/groups/fablabbib/

#This script has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 scomputer with:
#- Raspbian Stretch
#- Python (2 or 3) - https://www.python.org/
#- VLC - https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
#- Python-VLC bindings - https://wiki.videolan.org/Python_bindings 
#- Free piano keys samples from the Piano Notes 1 Octave from pinkyfinger on Freesound.org - https://freesound.org/people/pinkyfinger/packs/4409/

#Upcoming tutorial at https://www.instructables.com/member/jocomakerspace/

#How to use
#Turn on Raspberry pi and download script
#Copy sounds to the same folder as your script
#Add the complete path to the sounds to your playlist list

#The party starts below this line!

#We import the time module
import time

#We import the VLC module
import vlc

#We start by defining the opening prompt to the audience
prompt = ("Scan a barcode to play some music")

#We define lists to process the input from the barcode scanner
playing = []
played = []

#We define a list to store the path to the sounds on your Raspberry Pi
